Radarx is a Python library built for radar data processing, and visualization. The library integrates tightly with `xradar` and leverages `xarray` and `DataTree` structures to enable easy and efficient manipulation of radar sweeps and volume data.

=================
Key Features
=================

- **Xradar Integration**: Uses `xradar` for reading radar data in different formats, providing a consistent interface for various radar types.
- **IMD Radar Data Support**: Special support for reading and processing IMD radar data in NetCDF format.
- **Volume Scanning**: Utilities to process radar sweeps and group them into complete volume scans.
- **Data Gridding**: Provides tools for converting radar data to regular Cartesian grids, supporting complex radar geometries.
- **Xarray and DataTree Structured Data**: Radar data is returned as `xarray` datasets, organized into `DataTree` structures for easy navigation and analysis.

=================
Installation
=================

You can install Radarx via `pip` from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pip install radarx

Alternatively, you can install it from source by cloning the repository and running:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/syedhamidali/radarx.git
    cd radarx
    python -m pip install .

=================
Usage
=================

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to use Radarx with `xradar` to load and process a volume scan:

.. code-block:: python

    import radarx as rx

    # List of radar files
    files = [
        'radar_file1.nc',
        'radar_file2.nc',
        'radar_file3.nc'
    ]

    # Read volume data using Radarx, with xradar integration
    volume = rx.io.read_volume(files)

    # Access a specific sweep or variable
    dbz_data = volume['/volume_0']['DBZ']

Radarx leverages `xradar` to handle radar file formats and integrates smoothly with `xarray` and `DataTree` for organizing and analyzing radar data.

=================
Xradar Integration
=================

Radarx makes use of the powerful `xradar` library for radar data ingestion and format handling. This ensures that the package is flexible and can handle a variety of radar data formats, including ODIM_H5, Sigmet, and others. For more advanced users, `xradar` functionality can be directly accessed to extend Radarx's capabilities.
